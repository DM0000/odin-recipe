    <p>Easy Peasy Pan Seared Steak Recipe</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 bone-in ribeye steaks, at least 1 1/2 inches thick, about 1 pound (450g) each</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) oil </li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30g) butter </li>
        <li>A few thyme sprigs and sliced shallots (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat steaks dry with paper towels. Season liberally with salt. Allow to rest at room temperature for at least 40 minutes and up to 2 hours. Alternatively, place on a plate or on a rack over a baking sheet in the refrigerator overnight. Remove from refrigerator at least 40 minutes before cooking. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large stainless steel or cast iron skillet over high heat until heavily smoking. Season steaks with pepper, add to pan, and cook, flipping frequently with tongs or cooking fork until internal temperature has reached 110째F (43째C) for rare or 130째F (54째C) for medium (steak will continue to cook for a bit afterward), 6 to 12 minutes depending on thickness. Add butter and optional aromatics to pan and continue to cook for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from pan and tent loosely with foil. Allow to rest for at least 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
